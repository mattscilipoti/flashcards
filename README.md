# flashcards
As a user, I should be able to...
1. View cards displayed in order on the screen, so I can select them by topic written on the front.
2. Click on the cards, and have them respond by flipping over,
so I can see the answer to the topic or question on the flip-side
3. Be prompted to answer a question for each card, so I can see whether or not I know the answer!
4. See whether I got the answer right or wrong, so if I'm right I can feel happy, and if I'm wrong I can go study so I can try again and get the answer right and feel happy!
5. Be able to click a button and refresh the page, so I can start over and try to get a perfect score.

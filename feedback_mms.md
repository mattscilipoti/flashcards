## Overview:

Looks great!  It's fun getting it too look just the way you imagined it, isn't it?

You coded a working game after only two weeks of coding.  That's pretty cool.

User stories competed?  Check!  You executed well and didn't reach too far.  Your commits show a smooth progression.

We'll work on removing the duplication from your code.  This will make it easier to reason about, maintain, and grow.

Keep up the good work.

## Rubric:

* __Project Workflow__: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

    **Exceeds Expectations**. Superb readme.  Nice and clear user stories.  Thanks for sharing your process.  I especially like #4 ( check my work regularly and hit the books if I need to).  Kudos.

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

    **Meets Expectations** We're only two weeks in!  Good job.  The commits show a smooth progression.  Unfortunately, the code in github doesn't match what you presented, o I was unable to play with it.

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission? Did you deliver something of value to the end user (not just a login button and an index page)?

    **Exceeds expectations** From the readme, to the questions, to the code, your personality shines through.  Kudos.

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

    **Meets expectations** Good job.  Well organized, clean logic, good naming.  We've got to work on the duplication.  This will come as you learn more.  Review my code comments in this [Pull Request](https://github.com/iamjustinprice/flashcards/pull/1) (prefixed with my initials - "mms").

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations? _(Note that this part of your feedback evaluation will take place during your one-on-one code review with your instructors, after you've completed the project.)_

    **Meets expectations** Good job solving the problems your user stories presented. Next we'll work on the problem of organizing code and finding the right home for styling.

Good job.  Keep it up.  You're on the right track.
